An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons We present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet (MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network [36] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our input to the output [34, 49].

When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts 3x3 conv, 128 7x7 conv, 64, /2 7x7 conv, 64, /2 in Figure), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still performs identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded pool, /2 pool, /2 pool, /2 output for increasing dimensions.
